# CS280-Unity

## Summary
The game is a lockstep[1] turn-based strategy game where the player is a cthulhu-esque[2] alien creature that creates eldritch tentacle abominations. Choose where to move in the map and make sure the health pool[3] doesnâ€™t hit 0. The player must upgrade[4] their attacking capabilities by spreading and taking over nearby continents. Strategize and take over before turns[5] run out and the humans find out how to exile the eldritch.
