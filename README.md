# CS280-Unity

## Summary
The game is a lockstep turn-based strategy game where the player is a cthulhu-esque alien creature that creates eldritch tentacle abominations. Choose where to move in the map and make sure the health pool doesnâ€™t hit 0. The player must upgrade their attacking capabilities by spreading and taking over nearby continents. Strategize and take over before turns run out and the humans find out how to exile the eldritch.
